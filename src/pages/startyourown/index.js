  `Subject: Inquiry About Unused Boxes - Possible Donation
 
Hello, 

My name is [firstname lastname] and I am reaching out to see if [your group] would be interested in donating one of your old and unused newspaper boxes to a community engagement project. I am an [job/passion/occupational title] from [City, STATE] and have been co-working on the project, ‚ÄúThe Wabash Art Drop‚Äù. The Art Drops follow the same general concept of the ‚Äúlittle free libraries‚Äù with its take one, leave one functionality; promoting community building through free art exchange. We have been rolling out these boxes in various parts of the country, and were hoping to bring it to the community in [city you‚Äôre bringing the box to] next! 

This project has been a huge success in Chicago, and I am reaching out in hopes that you would be willing to help move this project forward by donating a box to us! 
Here is a link to the instagram page for the current box located in Downtown Chicago. The impact of the Wabash Art Drop has allowed collaboration within the arts and urban community. You‚Äôll see highlights of this engagement and impact, saved in the ‚ÄúSwaps and Shares‚Äù saved stories at the top of the page. 
  
Thank you so much for your consideration,
[firstname lastname]

  `Hi [firstname lastname of person you‚Äôre contacting] üëã
 
I'm [firstname lastname], a [job/passion/occupational title] based in [city ur from]. I‚Äôve been collaborating on a project called the ‚ÄúWabash Art Drop‚Äù‚Äì‚Äìthese art drops follow the same concept of the ‚Äúlittle free libraries‚Äù with their take one, leave one functionality. The project also works to promote community building through free art exchange. We have been rolling out these boxes in various parts of the country, and we are in the final steps of bringing it to [the city you‚Äôre bringing the box to]! 
   
Similar to Chicago, the City of Portland requires each box to have a name and number attached to it. We have our original box sponsored with Columbia College Chicago‚Äôs Office of Student Affairs. So in order to get the box recognized by the city, we would just need your last bit of help.
I am reaching out in hopes that the [business / school you‚Äôd be requesting a sponsor from] would be willing to help sponsor the box. We would only need the box to be sponsored with a contact number; for example, our current box has the contact number for the Student Affairs office.
The upkeep of the box will be taken care of by the community (cleaning, ensuring it meets city regulations, etc.). I will be traveling to [the city you‚Äôre bringing the box to] in the month of January, and plan on setting up the box with several PSUGD students. 
   
Please let me know if getting the office‚Äôs number on the box would be possible! We would love to have the box in front of the [business you‚Äôre contacting] or in the surrounding area‚Äì‚Äìfor use by not only [city artists], but also for any surrounding [colleges or visiting artists]. 
   
Thank you for your consideration,
[firstname lastname]
